<p><font size="3">Two NT machines, Hornet and Zealand, are
connected on the same link (global prefix = 3ffe:1a01:4:b::/64).
To communicate using IPSec, the SPD and SAD of each machine must
have the correct policies and associations. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Click here to see Hornet&#146;s </font><a
href="h_ex_sp.txt"><font size="3">SPD</font></a><font size="3">
and </font><a href="h_ex_sa.txt"><font size="3">SAD</font></a><font
size="3">. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Click here to see the Zealand&#146;s </font><a
href="z_ex_sp.txt"><font size="3">SPD</font></a><font size="3">
and </font><a href="z_ex_sa.txt"><font size="3">SAD</font></a><font
size="3">. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The key files are the private keys. Simple
strings are used here (</font><a href="ZeaHor.key"><font size="3">ZeaHor.key</font></a><font
size="3"> </font><a href="HorZea.key"><font size="3">HorZea.key</font></a><font
size="3"> </font><a href="keyloop.key"><font size="3">keyloop.key</font></a><font
size="3">). The key must be enclosed in quotes as the example
keys show. Note quotes cannot be used as a key symbol.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Both machines have loopback policies and
associations, which can be used for testing, when only one
machine is available. As the figure above illustrates, HTTP
traffic is protected with AH and ESP transport mode. All other
traffic, is protected by ESP transport mode.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To add policies and associations to the kernel,
first type: <b>ipsec c &lt;filename&gt; </b>(filename has no
extensions). This creates &quot;filename.spd&quot; and
&quot;filename.sad&quot; in the current directory. The only
policy is the default that allows all traffic. No SAs yet exist
in the SAD file. To view the current SPD and SAD, type: <b>ipsec
sp</b> or <b>ipsec sa</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Add the policies to the *.spd file and the
associations to the *.sad file following the example SPD and SAD.
Also, add the key files to the same directory as the *.spd and
*.sad files. Type: <b>ipsec a &lt;filename&gt;</b> to add the
policies and associations to the kernel. Only new entries are
added to the kernel. So, the default SP entry (#1) is not
modified. &quot;New&quot; just means the index number of the SP
or SA entry is greater than the highest current SP or SA entry
that is in the kernel. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The SPD is ordered from most specific to most
general. Most specific entries are ones with selectors defined to
specific values. A selector has three possible values: wildcard
(*), range (?-?), or specific (?). Looking at Hornet&#146;s </font><a
href="h_ex_sp.txt"><font size="3">SPD</font></a><font size="3">,
SP entry 4 is more specific than 3 due to the <strong>Protocol</strong>
selector being set to <strong>TCP</strong>. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nesting of IPSec is shown in SP entry 5. Here
the <strong>SABundleIndex</strong> is <strong>4</strong>
indicating that first SP entry 5 is applied and then SP entry 4.
SP entry 4 is never used alone due to SP entry 5 having the exact
same selectors.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">An SA entry is an instantiation of an SP entry.
Looking at the SP entries, the selectors have an indicator for
&quot;take from policy (-)&quot; or &quot;take from packet
(+).&quot; This means that the SA entry selectors are either
taken from the policy selectors or taken from the packet that
caused the SA to be created. The example uses &quot;take from
policy&quot; for simplicity and because manual keys are used.
When the SA selector is determined by the policy, the SAs
selector value is <strong>POLICY</strong>. A &quot;take from
packet&quot; indicator could be used instead to cause a more
specific SA meaning the SP could have many SAs. </font></p>
