This file describes the features of PDCurses for X that are still to
be completed.

- add newterm() function and have it create a new X window

- add X selection to allow PDCurses programs to provide an X selection

- provide for all outstanding curses functions

- add complete mouse support (but which convention - System VR4 or ncurses ?)

- provide a command line parsing function to enable X command line
  arguments to be parsed and stripped from the arguments passed back
  to the calling procedure.

- add proper 'flash' behaviour

- document how resizing works

- document how to use mouse functions that do exist

- tuidemo will dump core when exiting - need to determine why
