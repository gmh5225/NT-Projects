Introduction:
------------

 XCurses uses the System V IPC shared memory facility for sharing data
 between the curses program and the child process created to manage the
 X stuff. XCurses also uses sockets for communication between the
 processes.

 To use XCurses with an existing curses program, you need to make two
 changes to your code.

 The first is the addition of a definition of the program name as a
 global char pointer. eg.

#ifdef XCURSES
 char *XCursesProgramName="sample";
#endif

 This name is used as the title of the X window, and for defining X
 resources specific to your program.

 The second is a call to XCursesExit() just before exiting from your
 program. eg.

#ifdef XCURSES
 XCursesExit();
#endif
 exit(0);

 This call is required to enable the child X process to shut down cleanly
 and free up the shared memory it used.

 When compiling your curses application, you need to add -DXCURSES.

 XCurses programs use the X Toolkit Intrinsics libraries.  You will need
 to link your code with the following libraries under X11R5:
    Xaw Xmu Xt X11

 and under X11R6:
    Xaw Xmu Xt X11 SM ICE Xext

 The best method of determining which libraries you need, is to
 compile one of the demo programs and take note of the libraries
 it uses.

Here be Dragons!
----------------

 Be aware that curses programs that expect to have a normal tty underneath
 them will be very disappointed! Output directed to stdout after a call
 to system() (maybe even exec()) will go to the xterm that invoked the
 XCurses application, or to the console if not invoked directly from an
 xterm. Similarly, stdin will expect its input from the same place as
 stdout.

 This situation is not desirable, but I know of no simple way to get
 around this.

lines:             specifies the number of lines the "screen" will have
                   Directly equates to LINES
                   There is no theoretical maximum.
                   The minimum value must be 2.
                   Default:        24

cols:              specifies the number of columns the "screen" will have
                   Directly equates to COLS
                   There is no theoretical maximum.
                   The minimum value must be 2.
                   Default:        80

normalFont:        the name of a fixed width font, used for A_NORMAL attribute
                   Default:        7x13

boldFont:          the name of a fixed width font, used for A_BOLD attribute
                   Default:        7x13bold

                   NB. The dimensions of font and boldFont MUST be the same.

pointer:           the name of a valid pointer cursor
                   Default:        xterm

pointerForeColor:  the foreground colour of the pointer
                   Default:        black

pointerBackColor:  the background colour of the pointer
                   Default:        white

cursorColor:       the colour of the text cursor
                   Default:        Red

colorBlack:        the color of the COLOR_BLACK attribute
colorRed           the color of the COLOR_RED attribute
colorGreen         the color of the COLOR_GREEN attribute
colorYellow        the color of the COLOR_YELLOW attribute
colorBlue          the color of the COLOR_BLUE attribute
colorMagenta       the color of the COLOR_MAGENTA attribute
colorCyan          the color of the COLOR_CYAN attribute
colorWhite         the color of the COLOR_WHITE attribute
                   Defaults are obvious :)

bitmap:            the name of a valid pixmap file of depth 1 used for
                   the application's icon
                   Default:        a 32x32 or 64x64 pixmap depending on the 
                                   window manager

translations:      Translations enable the user to customise the
                   action that occurs when a key, combination of keys, or a
                   button is pressed.  The translations in XCurses are similar
                   in function and definition to translations used by xterm.
                   Defaults:
                        <Key>:                    XCursesKeyPress()
                        <Btn1Down>:               XCursesButton()
                        !Ctrl <Btn2Down>:         XCursesButton()
                        <Btn2Down>,<Btn2Up>:      XCursesPasteSelection()
                        <Btn3Down>:               XCursesButton()
                        <Btn1Up>:                 XCursesButton()
                        <Btn3Up>:                 XCursesButton()
                        <BtnMotion>:              XCursesButton()

                   The most useful action for KeyPress translations is string().
                   The argument to the string() action can be either a string or
                   a hex representation of a character. eg. string(0x1b) will
                   result in the ASCII escape character to be sent to the 
                   XCurses application. string("[11~") will result in [ 1 1 ~ 
                   being sent, as seperate keystokes to the XCurses application.

shmmin:            On most systems, there are two Unix kernel parameters that 
                   determine the allowable size of a shared memory segment. These
                   parameters are usually something like SHMMIN and SHMMAX. To use
                   shared memory, a program must allocate a segment of shared memory
                   that is between these two values.  Usually these values are
                   like 1 for SHMMIN and some large number for SHMMAX. Sometimes
                   the Unix kernel is configured to have a value of SHMMIN that is
                   bigger than the size of one of the shared memory segments that
                   XCurses uses. On these systems an error message like:

                     Cannot allocate shared memory for SCREEN: Invalid argument

                   will result. To overcome this problem, this XCurses resource
                   should be set to the kernel value for SHMMIN. This ensures that
                   a shared memory segment will always be bigger than the kernel
                   value for SHMMIN (and hopefully less than SHMMAX!)

                   Default:        0

borderColor:       the colour of the border around the screen
                   Default:        Black

borderWidth:       the width in pixels of the border around the screen
                   Default:        0

doubleClickPeriod: the period (in milliseconds) between two button
                   press events that determines if a double click
                   of a button has occurred.
                   Default:        200

composeKey:        the name of the X key that defines the "compose key" which
                   is used to enter characters in the Latin-1 character set above
                   0xA0.
                   Generally this key will be one of the X "modifier" keys, like
                   Alt_L, Meta_R etc. but can be a "normal" key like F1.  Try to 
                   While in "compose key" mode, the text cursor will appear as
                   a hollow rectangle.
                   See the file latin-1.man for details on compose key usage.
                   Default:        No key is defined

Using Resources:
---------------

 All XCurses applications have a top-level class name of "XCurses".
 The top-level widget name for each XCurses application is the
 same as that defined by the XCursesProgram name in the application's
 main source module.

 An example of an XCurses app-defaults or .Xdefaults file might be:

!

XCurses*cols:   80
