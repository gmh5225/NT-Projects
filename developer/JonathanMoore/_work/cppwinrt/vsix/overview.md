The C++/WinRT Visual Studio extension supplements the C++/WinRT compiler (cppwinrt.exe) and platform projection headers distributed with the Windows SDK, starting with the April 2018 release.  When updating the C++/WinRT VSIX, it's advisable to update Visual Studio and the Windows SDK as well.

Features include:
- Debug visualization of C++/WinRT projected types, providing an experience similar to C# debugging.
- Project and item templates for getting started with C++/WinRT application and runtime component development.

Note:
- With Visual Studio 2019, MSBuild support is no longer built into the C++/WinRT VSIX, but is provided by the standalone Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT NuGet package instead.
