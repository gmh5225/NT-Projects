# C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)

## Overview

Please visit [C++/WinRT](https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix/) in the Visual Studio Marketplace for official Microsoft-signed builds of the C++/WinRT VSIX.  See also the [Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT/) NuGet package, which provides build support for C++/WinRT vcxproj projects. 

The C++/WinRT VSIX provides:
* Debug visualization of C++/WinRT types, similar to the C# debugging experience.
* Project and item templates to help you get started with consuming and authoring Windows runtime classes in modern C++.
